ALPHA version 0.1 (proof-of-concept)

Prioritized list of issues:
* Fix repeat attack issue
* tests for code: 100% code coverage using coverage.py
* Passes flake8 style standards (check)
* Documentation and better readme
* go through code and address any remaining TODOs

future ideas (NOT GOING IN CURRENT RELEASE):
* Make it network-based. This is an obvious inclusion for any cryto-currency but as of right now its still a proof-of-concept
* Handle file appending so we don't have to rewrite a save file all over again

DONE:
* make way of adding "block rewards" and injecting money into the economy. We start with nothing!
* Design a better way to validate finances by caching this data somewhere so we don't have to go through a full transaction history
* REMOVED reciever signatures!
* implement mining and proof-of-work --> NOTE: mining and proof-of-work already exist in this project, they are just done automatically. In the future, when the app is network-based, mine will listen to transactions on the network and will attempt to complete the proof-of-work with those transactions
