ALPHA version 0.1 (proof-of-concept)

Prioritized list of issues:
* implement getFinances in ledger.py to ensure finances are available for transaction
* make application to use cryptographic ledger
* Fix repeat attack issue
* handle file appending so we don't have to rewrite a save file all over again
* tests for code: 100% code coverage using coverage.py
* Passes flake8 style standards (check)
* Documentation and better readme

future ideas (NOT GOING IN CURRENT RELEASE):
* Make it network-based. This is an obvious inclusion for any cryto-currency but as of right now its still a proof-of-concept
* Design a better way to validate finances by caching this data somewhere so we don't have to go through a full transaction history
* Mining rewards
